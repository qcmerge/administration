QCMerge Update - March 7, 2014
===

Here's what's goin' on with QCMerge

Administration:
---
* The Ohio Sec. of State has completed registration of Queen City Merge, LLC.
* A separate QCM bank account should be open by CoB today.

Community:
---
* Continuing to trumpet community events via Facebook page
* The pitch deck is complete but I'd like to tweak it a bit and get feedback from Chris M.

Education:
---
* The Eventbrite page for the Intro to Rails course is live! https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-ruby-on-rails-12-weeks-tickets-10670011291

Events:
---
* The March drinkup was last night. The hope is that ownership of the financial burden of the drinkup will be transferred from Gaslight by next month's drinkup.

Space:
---
* Would like to gauge Gaslight's interest in being co-located (on separate floors of the same building). This would be the "quickest" way for QCM to have "its own "space.
